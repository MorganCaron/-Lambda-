		</div>
		<p class="lead">
			It stands out from its competitors by its <strong>ease of use</strong> and its <strong>performance</strong>.<br>
			You can compare it to <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Angular</strong>, with the difference that <strong>ModularDom doesn't need to generate a DOM</strong> (Document Object Model). It is therefore much more powerful and its source code is very minimalist.
