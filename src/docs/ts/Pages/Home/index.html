		</div>
		<p class="lead">
			React, Angular and most other reactivity libraries and frameworks are much criticized.<br>
			<br>
			Some for their heaviness, slowness, difficulty to use, lack of cleanliness or difficulty to maintain a project through time.<br>
			<br>
			Developers would like to have a minimalist tool, compatible with all projects that doesn't require any particular dependency.

			<h2 is="tilted-block">What solutions does ModularDom offer?</h2>
		</div>
		<p class="lead">
			JavaScript already embeds all the features needed to design reactive web components.<br>
			You don't need ModularDom or any other framework! :laughing:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cross-browser (web standard) for creating and extending reusable components.</li>
			<li>Requires no library or framework to get started. Vanilla JS/HTML FTW!</li>
			<li>Provides a familiar programming model. It's just DOM/CSS/HTML.</li>
			<li>Works well with other new web platform features (Shadow DOM, <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>, CSS custom properties, etc.)</li>
			<li>Tightly integrated with the browser's DevTools.</li>
			<li>DOM allows you to dynamically modify page elements, no need for a virtual DOM.</li>
			<li>Leverage existing accessibility features.</li>
			<li>JavaScript functions to manipulate the browser history allow to react dynamically to url changes.</li>
			<li>No virtual DOM. Your app starts fast and stays fast.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="lead text-center">
			<strong>Yes, but these features are very verbose.</strong><br>
			<br>
			You don't need complex frameworks to create real web applications with components and reactivity.
			ModularDom is useful to you only for simplification and readability.
